Here, I have design the excel sum formula using Topological Sorting,  I implemented using Java.  This module works like  a real-time sum function in excel.
First We need to create an instance of excel using some rows and columns , then you can sum up any range of cell to any cell. If that cell is dependent on other cell then it will  change that  cell too.
